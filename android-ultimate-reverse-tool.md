The idea is to create ultimate android reverse tool, that have a lot of tools and have ui to better visuals.

Some tools:
* Automated deobfuscator. It can have machine learning skills.
* Decoder for apk, dex, odex, vdex in java code.
* Java encoder to apk with signature generator.
* Java-code editor.
* Frida scripts, like ssl unpinning.
